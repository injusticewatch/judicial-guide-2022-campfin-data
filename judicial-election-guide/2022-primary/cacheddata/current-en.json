Ross [was sued in 2009 by an election attorney](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2009-08-06-0908050654-story.html) she hired for allegedly failing to pay him more than $60,000 for his work. Ross counter-sued, claiming the attorney had exceeded his estimated hours without telling her. The case was ultimately settled. Several attorneys told Injustice Watch that Ross has been known for showing up late to court and has, on occasion, missed or continued hearings. At least one attorney mentioned she has improved in recent years. They asked to speak anonymously, because they still work in the domestic relations division and did not want to prejudice their clients. In a statement, Ross strongly refuted the allegations. “If I was late for a few or more of those 1000's (of) hearings and trials, not having been provided with a day, a month or even a year of the alleged tardiness or absence, how can I adequately respond to or refute a broad and ambiguous allegation?” she wrote. Additionally, she said, “It is more likely than not that a circumstance arose outside of my immediate control at the time and that was the reason I was not present for an undated and unspecified amount of my 1000's of hearings set to be heard from 2008 to 2022. Also, it is possible I was delayed for an unspecified amount of undated hearings of the approximately 1000's hearings set to be heard from 2008 to 2022. In either circumstance, tardy or not attended, the amount would surely be at the most overly exaggerated of averages, less than a fraction of a percent. Therefore, I reject the characterization of tardiness and not showing up being a reputation and I find it insulting.”\n","communityInvolvement":"\n","surveyExcerpt":"I have been a judge for more than 13 years in the Domestic Relations Division.

I attended Oscar Mayer Elementary School and Whitney Young High School.  I grew up in the Lincoln Park neighborhood, approximately 10 blocks from the Cabrini Green public housing complex.

My primary assignment was in the Child Protection Divisions.  Often I observed it was commonplace for people of color -- particularly women of color -- to come under scrutiny by the Department of Children and Family Services for imperfect parenting skills which, again, if demonstrated by a Caucasian parent would likely be ignored.  I was and would continue to be (if elected) concerned about ensuring that I exercised such power tempered by compassion and appreciation for how my decisions could adversely impact people's lives.

The imbalance of power both in terms of resources and \"intangibles\" such a peer appreciation (i.e., judges having implicit bias favoring lawyers or litigants who come from their same ethnic, socio-economic background) is a real thing and there are too many judges who are influenced by it, albeit subconsciously.  My approach has been, and would continue to be if elected, to keep in mind that this is a reality and be thoughtful and careful when making discretionary decisions that would unfairly favor a one litigant over the other because of money, power or resources.  The most common example, being how governmental entities abuse the discovery process to engage in \"hide the ball\" litigation tactics to wear down a lesser resourced opponents.  Any judge who has litigated knows when this happens and needs to be ready, willing and able to call out this behavior and not allow it to occur by ignoring it or giving countenance to it.  I could give more examples, but space limitations doe not permit me to do so. \n","q5":"I am thoroughly experienced and qualified to serve as a judge on the Illinois Appellate Court.  I do not seek this position to fulfill a \"dream\" or to cap off a career with an additional accolade.  Public confidence in the system of justice in the State of Illinois, particularly in Cook County, has significantly eroded due to revelations of systemic bias and a lack of accountability within the justice system.  While I cannot promise an outcome or that the voters will enjoy every ruling I make, I believe that voters should support my candidacy because I will follow the law and treat their families -- sons, daughters, sisters, mothers, etc. -- with the same dignity and respect that I would want my family to be treated by a judge.

When I was a young prosecutor, a woman came to court charged with several traffic violations and facing several hundred dollars in fines. The judge called the case and asked me what I wanted to do. I could tell that the fines that she was facing were more than this woman could afford. I dismissed the case, and when the judge told her what I did, she started to cry and gave me a hug. I didn't know if it meant that the woman no longer had to decide between buying food for her kids or paying the fines, but I did know that justice would not be served by subjecting her to that hardship. When I tell that story, I get goosebumps because it shows my understanding of the human aspect of the law that my parents taught.\n","q2":"When a litigant is in court, that is the most important thing in that person's life at that moment. Whether it is a traffic ticket, felony charge, lawsuit, or divorce, the judge's actions and decisions will shape the litigant's life in some way. I have witnessed both the good and bad in the judiciary, and believe that I have the experience to fully comprehend the power of a judge. I have treated others with respect and acted with integrity throughout my legal career, and I will continue to do so as a judge. As a judge, I know that I can help rebuild the faith and trust in the justice system through my actions and decisions by treating all with respect and fairness.  \n","q3":"The entire legal system, including judges, must work to ensure that EVERYONE has access to the court and are treated equally. I know the struggles of an overworked and understaffed public defender's office and the daunting labyrinth that self-represented litigants face when navigating the system because I have worked shoulder-to-shoulder with both. In my current position with the Clerk of the Circuit Court, I have worked with the judiciary to improve access to the court system by creating efficiencies and new programs benefiting individuals who cannot afford private lawyers. I now have an understanding of the administrative responsibilities of a judge that many do not, and I will carry that understanding into my career as a judge. \n","q5":"The tenets of honesty, integrity, and ability have long been instilled in me through my family. As a lawyer who has spent his entire career in the public sector, advocating for victims of crime, defending other public servants, and seeking to improve the court system, I have espoused those tenets. I have an even temper and understand the importance of listening to other perspectives. I have extensive criminal and civil litigation experience, and as such, I have both a depth and breadth of knowledge. Additionally, I have been active in the community and engaged in making a difference in the lives of others. I am a board member of an organization that works to provide services to children with learning disabilities, an organization that works to support reproductive rights of women, and I am a mentor to a high school student who is from a disadvantaged area of the city. I will always do what is right and just because that is how I have been raised.\n"}}},"type":"candidates","id":"rec1qN2DKcEPm0Jdz"},{"fields":{"candidateId":29680,"lastName":"QUINONES","firstName":"CARMEN MIGDALIA","sequence":3,"electionType":"Primary","partyName":"DEMOCRATIC","flags":[{"type":"flags","fields":{"name":"Negative ratings","description":"Two or more bar association have said this candidate is not recommended or not qualified to be a judge.

Rialmo killed LeGrier and his neighbor Bettie Jones while responding to a call for help. LeGrier’s father had told 911 dispatchers that his son was experiencing a mental health crisis. The jury in the case awarded LeGrier’s family $1.05 million, but Van Tine overturned the jury’s verdict based on a “special interrogatory” they signed saying that Rialmo was in reasonable fear of great bodily injury or death. Interrogatories are written questions about the facts of a case that any party in a lawsuit may ask a jury to answer separately from their verdict. The legal maneuver, commonly used in civil trials, has been criticized for confusing juries, and the jury foreperson in the LeGrier case [said he felt “hoodwinked” by Van Tine’s decision](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-met-robert-rialmo-jury-verdict-confusion-20180628-story.html) to negate the jury’s verdict. \n\nIn a statement, Van Tine said, “As a trial court judge, I am required to apply the law whether or not I agree with it.

I grew up in India, Canada and the United States. The skills that I learned bargaining for food and clothes on the dusty streets of Tiruchirappalli with my grandmother have made me an effective and respectful negotiator. Growing up learning several different languages has sharpened my sensitivity and acuity to litigants who do not speak English. My grandmother on my mother's side was the Principal of a Muslim all girls school in a Hindu town. My grandfather was the Principal of a Muslim college in the same town. They were both devout Christians, but they were loved by teachers, professors, students, neighbors and community members. They taught me the value of differences in people, and how to do one's job with competence, grace and seeming ease in an environment that would have been hard to impossible for less adaptable people.

I also take the time to explain my analysis and reasoning for ruling the way I do. That way, all sides understand why exactly why I am ruling how I'm ruling even if they don't necessarily agree with it.

In addition to attending school, I worked as soon I was able so that I could pay for my education, which I did on my own.  Although I am the first lawyer in my family, from a young age, I viewed the legal profession as a way to help people, especially those who lacked voice and power in society.

Again, experience has been a good teacher.  In my personal quest to become a judge, I have been stymied several times by “those with money, power and resources,” but I press on because I truly believe the judiciary needs judges who understand the inequities which continue to undermine our justice system.  \n","q5":"I have dedicated my career to helping people who have been marginalized or underrepresented in society; I have never been motivated by money, but by service to others. As we continue to make strides in social justice and fundamentally change the way we treat citizens who find themselves before the Court, I am even more certain that I can positively contribute my extensive experience, knowledge, patience, and empathy to the judiciary and thereby, continue to fulfill my life’s purpose, which is to help others.  During the 2020 election cycle, I received almost a quarter million votes for judge.

Consequently, I have always sought opportunities where I would be able to address injustices. An example was at the Independent Police Review Authority, where I investigated police misconduct. Without cause, police officers took a young man into custody, drove him around in the back of their squad car, and dropped him off miles away at night in an unfamiliar neighborhood. Despite colleagues feeling the punishment was harsh, I made recommendations that the officers receive suspensions-they did.  Also, as an Administrative Law Judge with the State of Illinois, I presided over thousands of appeals. Appellants often stated how they felt heard in my hearings.

[In an interview with Injustice Watch](https://www.injusticewatch.org/news/judicial-elections/2022/jackie-portman-brown-running-again/), Portman-Brown said the girl’s mother asked her to put her in the holding cell after she’d been having behavior problems in school. “There are some who didn’t understand the tough love mentality that was intended for my grandniece, but there were a lot of people in this community who were raised with that.

There, I learned solid Midwestern values about caring for others in the community, which I took with me to New York City, where I attended New York University for my B.A. and Columbia University School of Law for my J.D.  I believe the core values I learned from growing up inspired me to pursue public interest law (as opposed to firm life or corporate law).  My internships throughout law school and my 25-year career path ever since have focused on helping others through public interest law and government service, including most recently as Chief Administrative Law Judge for the Illinois Human Rights Commission. In addition, I am very active in the community, particularly in education- and youth-focused causes, which has influenced my desire to serve others with my legal abilities.\n","q2":"I realized a life-long dream when the Illinois Supreme Court first appointed me to the bench as Circuit Judge in 2019, and now I proudly serve as Associate Judge.

I approach this problem by taking extra time to explain courtroom procedures and make referrals to legal resources. I believe that pandemic-driven innovations in remote court access can help poorer litigants, e.g., allowing participation without losing time from work, hiring childcare, or incurring transportation costs. That said, technological hurdles remain for many. I therefore believe in partnering with the Illinois Judges Association, bar associations, and community organizations to increase access, develop resources for self-represented litigants, educate the public, and diversify the profession to ensure minority perspectives are well represented. I also believe every judge should seek education on the issues facing underrepresented groups and take every CLE opportunity to learn to check implicit biases that could impact their decisions.\n","q5":"I have the knowledge, experience, and temperament to do the job well. I bring to the bench a strong, well-rounded background of legal and judicial experience. I am a coalition-builder. I have gained the respect of my judicial colleagues who elected me as Associate Judge and frequently seek my advice on their own cases. Similarly, while Circuit Judge, I built a wide network of support across Cook County, including endorsements from over seventy respected public officials and organizations, demonstrating I can bring people together. I believe my ability to build bridges has and will contribute to civility in the courthouse, which increases respect for the judicial process. I also am a single mother of two and credit my children and my dedication to public service as the sources of the compassion and integrity I display on the bench.

Unfortunately, police misconduct is a real problem in Chicagoland - which I know not only due to the nature of my work, but also because, as a teenager, I was personally a victim of police misconduct.  To put it bluntly, my personal experiences with Chicago police led me to pursue a career as a plaintiff's civil rights attorney.  My ability to maintain that practice for decades was made possible due to my background as the son of self-made, hard-working, immigrants.  My parents instilled in me the value of hard work, perseverance and never giving up – attributes that are essential when fighting “City Hall” in literally every one of my cases.\n","q2":"Most current Cook County Judges worked for the government before becoming Judges.

As an advocate, I have fought to change that reality.\n\nOf course, it is a given that a judge's role should always be to fairly apply the facts to the applicable law in every single case (because doing otherwise improperly tips the scales in favor of one side over the other).  But a Judge cannot ignore the background of the litigants before the Court – with all the attendant disadvantages that the particular litigant has had to overcome or contend with in life.

I am the son of Greek immigrants that came to this country with nothing but the will to succeed – a background that has taught me to overcome negative stereotypes, to persevere, and to never back down against the powerful.

I attended public grammar and high schools, before transferring to and graduating from Notre Dame College Prep in 1978.  I graduated from the University of Illinois in 1983.  I graduated from DePaul University Law School in 1987.  While I was growing up, my parents were always very active in social and political causes such as the civil rights movement, the anti-war movement, and opposing nuclear proliferation.  While I was in law school, both of my parents were sentenced to federal prison for participating in symbolic acts of nuclear disarmament (the Plowshares Movement).

I was cognizant of the possibility that their right to due process and a favorable disposition of their case may be compromised because another defendant in a similar situation and faced with similar charges would receive a more favorable outcome for no other reason than (s)he could afford a private attorney.

In 2014, she represented a client [who filed a lawsuit alleging sexual harassment against Dan Rutherford](https://abc13.com/archive/9428147/), then the Illinois state treasurer and a Republican candidate for governor. Rutherford accused Svenson and her client of fabricating the allegations to help his opponent in the Republican primary election, Bruce Rauner. Svenson denied political motivations. She said a previous $3,500 payment from Rauner’s campaign was for unrelated legal work.\nSvenson has worked on several cases with Judicial Watch, a conservative legal group. In a 2015 case, Svenson represented a client who filed a lawsuit in Cook County asking the court to force the county’s cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainer requests, which ask local jails to hold people who immigration officials suspect are in the country illegally. The county had passed a 2011 ordinance ordering the sheriff not to comply. A Cook County judge dismissed the lawsuit, and the Illinois Appellate Court later dismissed an appeal filed by Svenson, saying the case briefs submitted on her client’s behalf were “completely deficient” and that there was a “complete failure to provide any reasoned argument about the facts of the present case,” [Injustice Watch reported](https://www.injusticewatch.org/news/2018/voter-conundrum-bar-groups-send-mixed-messages-about-some-judicial-hopefuls/). In an emailed statement, Svenson said she had approved the documents but did not write them.

I have wanted to represent individuals in court since I can remember. I was fortunate to have wonderful parents who taught me \"right and wrong\" at a young age. I also learned at an early age how the court system can completely destroy the lives of very good people. My three best friends were the product of divorces and suffered greatly because of the manipulations of unscrupulous lawyers and bad judges. For this reason, I had and still have the desire to help individuals going through unfortunate situations in court.\n","q2":"If selected to serve as a judge, I intend to prioritize the legal needs of families, and ensure they are given the same time, dignity and respect as other players in the system.  \nAccording to people that I respect, I pose the proper demeanor, temperament and compassion to be a highly effective judge. My experience representing clients in family law has trained me to excel at listening carefully to people, and giving them the dignity and respect they deserve. As such, I am able to eliminate emotion from the equation, and handle cases in a truly dispassionate and impartial manner.\nAs a lifelong litigator, I have had firsthand dealings with an area of the law that is rarely dealt with: civility inside and outside the courtroom. I am heartened when I go before a judge who recognizes these situations and is able to “rein in” the bad actor. This is an important and little talked about function of a judge.\nThere are certainly some individuals who view the position as one of \"power.\" I view the position as one that serves the people of the community.\n","q3":"It is very important that every single person gets a fair shot in court and has the same impartial, level playing field, regardless of economic or other status. There is absolutely no doubt that the term \"celebrity justice\" exists for a reason. In my courtroom, every individual and every lawyer will be treated the exact same way - with dignity and respect. The case of an indigent person will get the same time and attention as that of a well-heeled individual with a slick lawyer. For over 15 years I have served as a Mediator and a Mandatory Arbitrator in Cook County. As one of three co-panelists, and often serving as chair of the panel, I hear arguments presented by both sides, weigh the facts, and then render a decision. In this capacity I have a proven track record of impartially in evaluating cases, a skill that is essential for a Circuit Court Judge.\n","q5":"Judges have a responsibility to be on the lookout for unnecessary delay and expense, and are uniquely positioned to do something about it. The most effective way for judges to reduce delay is by working hard, holding themselves accountable, and issuing rulings as quickly as possible. In most cases, a good order rendered in seven days is more helpful to the parties than a perfect order rendered in seven months.\nActive judicial case management is essential in making litigation less expensive, more efficient, and more expeditious. A firm trial date that gets set early in the process is critical. In many cases judges should confer with the parties early in the litigation and require them to agree to a trial date, and then not allow the case to be continued (rescheduled) absent an extraordinary, unforeseen change in circumstances. In closing, I will move cases in the most fair and rapid manner which would renew confidence in the judicial system.\n"}}},"type":"candidates","id":"recQofzVkkU1KclzD"},{"fields":{"candidateId":29739,"lastName":"SEYRING","firstName":"GARY WILLIAM","sequence":2,"electionType":"Primary","partyName":"REPUBLICAN","experience":"**Law Offices of Gary W.

Over the next 30 years, I resided in the South Suburbs and Chicago for different phases of my life. I was raised with three basic principles (1) if you want to accomplish something you must work, (2) never lie, and, (3) no regrets. We get one opportunity in this world and as my Dad said make it matter. From the moment I chose law, my priorities were work and the law. Then our daughter passed away in 1992. That changed my everything, my perspective, my world and I realized that in a blink that which you thought you can control you cannot. My loss shifted my perspectives. I began to listen more, to recognize the big things are not so big, and, I began realized there was more to my degree than just work. I felt driven too give back. I started working part-time with CARPLS all the while maintaining full-time employment. After leaving CARPLS, I began to provide pro bono with the bar associations and currently as a director and attorney of a non-for- profit organization assisting victims of domestic violence. My motto is adapt, learn, listen and pivot.\n","q2":"I want to be a judge as I believe that I will be excellent in this position. I love the law and the impact of the law on everyday life to each and everyone one of us. It is important to note, the law is the same for all of us. It is the application of the law that is critical in each case. A judge holds power over those that appear before him/her. Because of this power, it is important for a judge to acknowledge and respect that with the power comes responsibility. A responsibility to apply the law equally, fairly, and, respectfully to those before them. To do so, a judge must learn to listen, not only to what is being said but to what is not being said; to treat all with respect; and, to provide everyone with a right to be heard. Being a judge is a job, a job that can have a huge impact on a person's life and that should never be taken for granted. My 30+ years of experience, of applying and litigating the law on behalf of clients in many areas of the law as well as appearing before more judges than I can count, provides me with a strong foundation of knowledge and experience to take on this responsibility and role.\n","q3":"If elected, I will do what I have done for the last 30+ years and that is to handle each matter before me as a new matter without concern over money, power or/and resources. I will apply the law, the law that is the same to all, to the facts of the matter before me. Like each and everyone of my clients, opposing counsel or adverse litigants, I will see the litigant before me as a person. A person whom I owe a responsibility to. A responsibility to getting it right, by treating the litigant with the respect that everyone should receive not withstanding their resources. I will listen, I will weigh, and, I will rule only on the matters before me. I wish I could say that money, power and resources do not take precedence in some courtrooms, as I have been witness to and represented clients against such influences, all, I can say is that money, power and resources will not be a factor when I am sitting in the position of judge. Everyone should have equal access to the courts and a ruling based solely on the law and the facts. \n","q5":"Voters should support my candidacy as a judge as I have the experience and qualifications to navigate the legal system. A diverse experience that provides me a grasp on the law and the application of the law on behalf of litigants and an understanding on how cases unfold from start to completion and the work that is necessary to accomplish resolution in all matters.\n"}}},"type":"candidates","id":"recL6cc38qMbuUHsa"},{"fields":{"candidateId":29601,"lastName":"GLEFFE","firstName":"JIM","sequence":2,"electionType":"Primary","partyName":"DEMOCRATIC","flags":[{"type":"flags","fields":{"name":"Negative ratings","description":"Two or more bar association have said this candidate is not recommended or not qualified to be a judge.

Gleffe was a longtime precinct captain under Madigan in Chicago’s 13th Ward. He quipped at the [Democratic Party’s pre-slating event last year](https://www.injusticewatch.org/news/judicial-elections/2021/pre-slating-judicial-candidates-2022-primary/) that he is “so committed to the Democratic Party that I actually met my wife checking petition signatures at the Board of Elections.” Bauer is a registered lobbyist. She has represented clients including the Chicago Teachers Union; Facebook; ComEd, which is embroiled in a bribery scandal that led to Madigan’s indictment last year; and Green Thumb Industries, a cannabis company that was one of the first to receive licenses to grow medical marijuana in Illinois, [according to the _Chicago Tribune_](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/criminal-justice/ct-green-thumb-industries-chicago-marijuana-federal-investigation-20210329-kaccpshrgjakhdkovp7mmwklgi-story.html).\nIn 2019, Gleffe was involved in efforts to challenge the ballot petitions of David Krupa, a college student who was running against 13th Ward Ald. Marty Quinn. Gleffe notarized several dozen affidavits from residents who said they wanted to withdraw their signatures from Krupa’s nominating petitions. But the Quinn campaign collected far more affidavits than the number of signatures Krupa had collected, leading to questions about the veracity of the affidavits, [the _Chicago Tribune_ reported](https://www.chicagotribune.com/politics/ct-democratic-slating-gleffe-judge-madigan-20211210-uvzqcplxdfhntkncqvmc5u2ema-story.html). In a statement, a spokesperson for his campaign said, “The role of a notary is only to verify that the person signing a document is who they say they are. A notary has no investigative or judicial power or duty to independently verify what a document asserts. Jim carried out his notary duties in full compliance with the law. Many lawyers serve as notaries, and no one has ever questioned the authenticity of the documents Jim notarized.”\nGleffe and his wife are the main donors to his campaign. But he has also received smaller campaign contributions from labor groups, including Chicago Regional Council of Carpenters PAC and Chicago Land Operators Joint Labor Management PAC, and politicians, including Cook County Commissioner Larry Suffredin, state Sen. Ram Villivalam, and Chicago Ald.

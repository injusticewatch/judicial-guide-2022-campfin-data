According to the suit, DiFranco, who had just begun working in felony review for the state’s attorney’s office, took a coerced confession from Maysonet and his girlfriend after a marathon interrogation session in which Guevara repeatedly beat him. The suit also alleges that DiFranco lied on the stand during Maysonet’s trial when he said that he took the confession in English, even though Maysonet did not speak fluent English at the time, according to his attorney. In a deposition taken last year, DiFranco maintained that he took Maysonet’s statement in English. Maysonet’s conviction was vacated in 2016 and in 2017 prosecutors decided not to re-try the case.\n\nIn an email to *Injustice Watch*, DiFranco denied Maysonet’s allegations and said that he still believes that Maysonet is guilty. “I have never and would never fabricate a statement of a defendant or anyone else for that matter,” he wrote. \n\nDiFranco was also an attorney and close friend of Rev. John P. Smyth, the former head of Maryville Academy, a Catholic school for troubled kids in Des Plaines. DiFranco adamantly defended Smyth against accusations that he sexually abused several boys during his time as head of the school. “It never happened. It’s a lie.

Evanston Township Committeeman Eamon Kelly, who chaired the party’s judicial retention committee, said his committee’s recommendation was based on “voices of juvenile justice advocates, law professors, foundation leaders, legal aid attorneys who described him as imperial...not collaborative and said he has obstructed efforts to reform the criminal justice system.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Toomin [came under fire](https://www.injusticewatch.org/news/2020/judge-blocks-key-legal-protection-for-detained-youth/) for making it harder for juveniles seeking release from detention during the coronavirus pandemic. Last year, [he ruled](https://www.injusticewatch.org/news/2019/illinois-appellate-court-rejects-ordinance-banning-detention-of-10-12-year-olds/) that an ordinance passed unanimously by the Cook County Board of Commissioners banning the detention of youth under 13 was invalid because it conflicted with Illinois law. His ruling was upheld on appeal.\n\nIn September, [Injustice Watch reported](https://www.injusticewatch.org/news/judicial-elections/2020/table-of-wisdom-toomin-burke/) that Toomin had taken part in an investment club with other judges and attorneys, including indicted Alderman Ed Burke.\n\nToomin has also presided over several high-profile cases, including the manslaughter case against former Mayor Richard M. Daley’s nephew, R.J. Vanecko, in the death of David Koschman, and the case against former “Empire” star Jussie Smollett. In a statement, a spokesperson for Toomin alleged that the Democratic Party’s “no” vote was retaliation for Toomin’s criticism of Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx’s handling of the Smollett case.","ratings":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"1oxTOWRmWZwOMjuywFyRfa"}},{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"66QC0uULKTLYDofhL4ajvr"}},{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"5QjNwt2y75tKP2mKJ1dbyE"}}],"flags":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"3tMsPtTrzzGu2ORV80SbAK"}},{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"5GK3WZxtqTZbeUPtKOLsZ2"}}],"photo":"https://www.injusticewatch.org/wp-content/uploads/Michael-Toomin.jpg","stories":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"3ZxcPykCLtdX2ueYftPvPe"}},{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"7N34p07TmRgbD6fmOvKfmU"}},{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"1KbSogYp2muIrvIgsuzRkP"}},{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"OisSU9nBPdpydrZGipRZp"}}]}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"wljxda7v5bkj"}},"id":"3zfvmSKd97NR2GrMrJaw0D","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2020-10-01T17:08:57.796Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-01T17:08:57.796Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"candidates"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"PATRICIA MANILA MARTIN","slug":"patricia-manila-martin","lastName":"MARTIN","firstName":"PATRICIA MANILA","candidateId":27269,"city":"CHICAGO","sequence":0,"currentJob":"Child protection division, presiding judge","judgeSince":1996,"bio":"Patricia Manila Martin was elected to the Circuit Court in 1996.

He also said he testified in support of the use of police body-worn cameras before a legislative committee in 2014.","ratings":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"66QC0uULKTLYDofhL4ajvr"}},{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"3FVIV3eXFEdd3Kt0PvnYkR"}},{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"5QjNwt2y75tKP2mKJ1dbyE"}}],"flags":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"BS0X9dmJNIbrRomk5BdM9"}}],"photo":"https://www.injusticewatch.org/wp-content/uploads/Patrick_Coughlin.jpg","stories":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"6fdFZKZPxM8QQ0jQxWK3FK"}},{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"1I0RL4DP1kBi9JlvpLv4Vi"}}]}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"wljxda7v5bkj"}},"id":"56HyEAKLb4MtvFKCVaK7xD","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2020-10-01T17:13:07.748Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-01T17:13:07.748Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"races"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"general for COOK -

In 1996, before he was elected to the bench, he was the director of court services for the Circuit Court.","notable":"Wadas has had his decisions reversed by the Illinois Appellate Court 25 times since 2014, more than any other criminal court judge running for retention this year. The appeals court has reversed him for overly harsh sentences, violating the “one act, one crime” doctrine, and assuming a prosecutorial role during trials.\n\nIn 1999, he presided over [the trial of Robert Wilson](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2006-11-15-0611150127-story.html), who was charged with attempted murder for allegedly attacking a woman at a bus stop with a box cutter. Wadas prevented Wilson’s attorney from introducing evidence about another man who had confessed to five similar attacks at bus stops in the same area in the two weeks after Wilson was arrested. Wilson was exonerated after almost a decade behind bars.\n\nIn 2004, Wadas sentenced Benard McKinley to 100 years in prison for a murder he committed when he was 16. After a federal appeals court determined that Wadas had not adequately considered McKinley’s age in issuing what it called “a certain death sentence,” Wadas [resentenced him to 39 years](https://www.injusticewatch.org/news/2019/after-courts-order-new-sentence-cook-county-prisoner-given-39-years-for-murder-committed-as-youth/), just one year less than the number the Illinois Supreme Court has said is an unconstitutional life sentence for a juvenile. Though he was 16 when the crime occurred, Wadas said during the resentencing hearing, “the gun made him older.”\n\nAs a prosecutor, Wadas was rebuked by the Appellate Court, calling his trial behavior in one case “an insult to the court and to the dignity of the trial bar,\" the [Chicago Tribune reported](https://www.chicagotribune.com/investigations/chi-020103trial5-story.html). Wadas declined to comment.","ratings":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"66QC0uULKTLYDofhL4ajvr"}},{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"1oxTOWRmWZwOMjuywFyRfa"}},{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"5QjNwt2y75tKP2mKJ1dbyE"}}],"flags":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"1co1JAiGdvKxduELaK5THa"}},{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"5GK3WZxtqTZbeUPtKOLsZ2"}},{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"BS0X9dmJNIbrRomk5BdM9"}}],"stories":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"IklrAFGEvDHm6qNWanTKc"}},{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"5GrX34sRgDeqZFhiIdyLlH"}},{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"5dExSHMmOrn9OzYEVx3Jiw"}}]}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"wljxda7v5bkj"}},"id":"6GueguQ05NsRKyRDZTlOMp","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2020-10-01T17:13:32.543Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-01T17:13:32.543Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"races"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"retention for COOK CIRCUIT -

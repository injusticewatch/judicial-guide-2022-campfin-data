They have the power to take someone’s freedom, enforce or overturn state laws, and correct or perpetuate injustices. Yet there are few places to get information about the people running for judge. That's why Injustice Watch created this guide to judicial candidates running in Cook County’s primary elections on June 28, 2022.\n\nIllinois voters elect judges every two years. **This year, 75 candidates are running for 29 judicial vacancies in Cook County.** Every voter will get to choose candidates to fill two appellate court seats and 10 circuit court seats. You may also have one or two subcircuit races on your ballot depending on where you live. Judges elected from subcircuits have the same responsibilities as other circuit court judges, but only people who live in that subcircuit can vote for them.\n\nOur team spent months researching the candidates’ legal experience, community involvement, donors, political connections, conduct, and controversies. We sent every candidate a survey asking why they deserve your vote. And we collected recommendations from bar associations, groups of lawyers who interview and rate judicial candidates. \n\n**Here's everything you need to be an informed voter.**","ratings.scale.negative":"Negative ratings","profile.candidateimage.alt":"Photo of candidate","flaglegend.helplink":"What do these mean?","campfin.readmore":"Read more on Illinois Sunshine →","campfin.amount":"Amount","footer.nonprofit":"Injustice Watch is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.

Last year, he ruled that an ordinance passed unanimously by the Cook County Board of Commissioners banning the detention of youth under 13 was invalid because it conflicted with Illinois law. His ruling was upheld on appeal.\nIn September, Injustice Watch reported that Toomin had taken part in an investment club with other judges and attorneys, including indicted Alderman Ed Burke. \nToomin has also presided over several high-profile cases, including the manslaughter case against former Mayor Richard M. Daley’s nephew, R.J. Vanecko, in the death of David Koschman, and the case against former “Empire” star Jussie Smollett.
